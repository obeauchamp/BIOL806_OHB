Hello, All!

My name is Olivia and I'm a second year Microbiology Ph.D. student! I work in the lab of Dr. Vicki Jeffers and we study gene expression in the parasite Toxoplasma gondii.

My research focuses on transcriptional initiation in the parasite. I study transcription factor binding at un-characterized promoter sequences.
